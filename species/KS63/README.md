# KS63 - KoopaShell63
This version of KoopaShell has some specialised functions, such as `warplevel`, for Super Mario 63.

KoopaScript code can also be run directly from signs in the Level Designer using `<script>` tags, e.g.
`<script:print %vKS63Installed>`
Note that this requires that stringData be installed.
